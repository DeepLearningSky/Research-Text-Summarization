# Extractive Summarization Techniques

This section contains codes for generation of extractive summary using graph-based methods like Lex-Rank (implemented in python based **sumy** module). The summaries hence generated serve as baseline for our task. 

Also, we modify the module for generating ~2000 word summaries which serve as input to our sequence-to-sequence model.
